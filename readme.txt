	PC_Term (Product Code Terminator) is a tool created to erase all product codes from a PLU file from a Sapphire or a Commander.  To use the tool place your store export in the folder marked Put_XMLs_Here and then run the PC_Term.exe tool.  Then use the option to import your backup.  When done use the option to export your backup.  This will create two folders.  The one marked Processed_XMLs is the processed files and the one marked BackUp_XMLs is a backup of the original files.  Both folders are time stamped to be able to distinguish between several different file sets.  The tool also creates a log file for you to look at what was done.
